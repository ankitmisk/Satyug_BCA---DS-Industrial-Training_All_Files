    "# Python Flow Controls\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definition\n",
    "Flow control statements allow you to control the order in which code is executed in your programs. Python provides several flow control statements to help manage the flow of the program: `if`, `elif`, `else`, `for`, `while`, `break`, `continue`, and `pass`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conditional Statements\n",
    "Conditional statements are used to execute code based on a condition. The main conditional statements are `if`, `elif`, and `else`.\n",

    "### Syntax\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if condition1:\n",
    "    # code block to be executed if condition1 is true\n",
    "elif condition2:\n",
    "    # code block to be executed if condition2 is true\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    # code block to be executed if none of the above conditions are true\n"
